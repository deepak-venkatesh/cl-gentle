My practice from the book Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky. This book is freely available at the author's website. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/

I am using the revised edition published in 2013 by Dover. I got it from Amazon.

I have no experience in any dialect of LISP or in functional programming.
