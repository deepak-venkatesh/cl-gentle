First way:
The input argument is passed to a / primitive where the other argument comes from
a series of two ADD1. Net result is HALF function.

Second way:
Pass the input argument through a / primitive where the other argument is 0.5.
0.5 is got by 5 ADD1s passed through a / with ther other input being 10 ADD1s.
